Definitions

Somatic Alterations Not Detected (ND): Somatic alterations may be present that are below the limit of detection of this test. Certain sample
or variant characteristics may result in reduced analytic sensitivity. The absence of detectable somatic alterations in circulating cell-free DNA
does not preclude the presence of somatic alterations in the tumor.

Variant of Uncertain Significance: The functional consequences and clinical significance of alterations are unknown. Relevance of therapies
targeting these alterations is uncertain.

Deletion (Del): The following alteration was detected in this patient: BRCA1 S956del. Guardant360 detects short deletions in exons of certain
genes (see Table 1), including potential splice site-disrupting events.

*Nonsense mutation: A point mutation that results in a premature stop codon.

Interpretation

Somatic alterations were detected in the circulating cell-free DNA isolated from this patient's blood specimen. These genomic alterations are
cancer-associated somatic variants, some of which have been associated with either increased or reduced clinical response to specific
treatments. The percentage of altered cell-free DNA circulating (% cfDNA) in blood is related to the unique tumor biology of each patient.
Factors that may affect the % cfDNA of detected somatic alterations include tumor growth, turn over, size, heterogeneity, vascularization,
disease progression, and treatment.

DOB: OCT-21-1965 | Test Number 2

Method and Limitations

Guardant360 sequences 74 cancer-associated genes to identify somatic alterations. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is extracted from plasma,
enriched for targeted regions, and sequenced using the Illumina platform and hg19 as the reference genome. All exons are sequenced in
some genes; only clinically significant exons are sequenced in other genes. The types of genomic alterations detected by Guardant360
include single nucleotide variants, gene amplifications, fusions, short insertions/deletions (longest detected, 70 base pairs), and splice sitedisrupting events (see Table 1). Microsatellite Instability (MSI) is assessed for all cancer types by evaluating somatic changes in the length of
repetitive sequences on the Guardant360 panel. A "Not Detected" result in samples where the highest % cfDNA is < 0.2% is an inconclusive
result because it does not preclude MSI-High status in tissue. MSI status is currently not reported for earlier panel versions. This version of
the Guardant360 test is not validated for the detection of other types of genomic alterations, such as complex rearrangements or gene
deletions. Certain sample or variant characteristics, such as low cfDNA concentration, may result in reduced analytic sensitivity. Guardant360
Cannot discern the source of circulating cfDNA, and for some variants in the range of ~40 to 60% cfDNA, the test cannot easily distinguish
germline variants from somatic alterations. Guardant360 is not validated for the detection of germline or de novo variants that are associated
with hereditary cancer risk. Tissue genotyping should be considered when plasma genotyping is negative, if clinically appropriate.

About the Test

The Guardant360 assay was developed and its performance characteristics were determined by Guardant Health, Inc. This test has not been
cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not
necessary. This test may be used for clinical purposes and should not be regarded as investigational or for research only. Guardant Health's
